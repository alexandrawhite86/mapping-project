        <p> New York State has a GDP of over $1.5 trillion, but there are still parts of New York City where households have no internet access. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, 14.7% of New York City households were without internet in 2019. According to data from Open Data NYC, over 30% of households in Borough Park, Brooklyn and Mott Haven, Bronx were without internet access in January 2020.   </p>

      <p> Mayor Bill de Blasio has made increasing internet access in New York City a priority. On Nov. 24, Mayor de Blasio announced that he would ensure that Verizon expands its broadband services to 500,000 households, especially in neighborhoods that were greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic like Borough Park. </p>

      <p>“Internet access is an economic right in New York City, no matter your ZIP code. Tech giants will not stand in our way to deliver high-quality broadband to New Yorkers – they must be a part of the solution,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio in a statement. The new settlement would create competition in areas where only one provider exists.  </p>
